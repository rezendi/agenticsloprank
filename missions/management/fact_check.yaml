  List all of the factual claims provided. Then, for each claim, briefly assess its credibility based on the verification / support from the corresponding sources. Be concise, no yapping.

        # List Factual Assertions

        What follows is text scraped from an online article.
        Briefly itemize all of the most salient factual assertions made in the article. Be terse and concise: no yapping.
        Note that projections and opinions, or claims that something _would_ or _could_ happen, are not factual assertions.
        Nor are judgement calls, arguable categorizations, indications, suggestions, attempts to draw conclusions, or any other subjective assessments.
        Focus strictly on verifiable, concrete, testable facts that are either true or false.

        Output your findings as a JSON list of strings, with the first string being a one-sentence summary of the article, and every subsequent string being a factual assertion.
